AnonToolBox - Easy to use tools for #Anons
==========================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

The AnonToolBox is NOT a hacker's toolbox!
It should help people without deep skills to prepare,
upload and spread infos! It should support free speech!

If you like to support or join the AnonToolBox Team,
send us your ideas for tools, code snippets or write
easy to understand documentation.

To get the AnonToolBox working, only a standard
Python2.6 (or newer) runtime should be available.

A local webserver supports with you with simple
to understand documentation/howtos.


Quickstart
==========

Download and buildout AnonToolBox

* git co PATH_TO_GITHUB_REPO
* cd anontoolbox
* python bootstrap.py
* bin/buildout

After bootstrapping, you can find all tools in the bin/ folder.

Feel free to send us your feedback!
